# AI Model Collection Website

## Overview
Welcome to our AI Model Collection website! This project aims to provide a comprehensive repository of various AI models, allowing users to explore different AI technologies, learn about their functionalities, and see demonstrations of their capabilities.

## Technologies Used
- **Framework**: React.js
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: React Router

## Page Load Time
We measured the page load time using SolarWinds Pingdom. The average page load time for our application is approximately 992 milliseconds. Additionally, our website received a performance grade of 93 (A), with no blocking time.

## Performance Optimizations
To achieve optimal performance, we implemented various optimizations:
- Utilized code splitting with React.lazy and React Suspense for lazy loading components.
- Optimized bundle size by removing unused dependencies and leveraging tree shaking.
- Implemented caching strategies for static assets to reduce server requests and improve load times.
- Leveraged Tailwind CSS for efficient styling and reduced CSS file size.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.

## Usage
